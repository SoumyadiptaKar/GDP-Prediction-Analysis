# LightGBM Prediction Improvements Summary

## Problem Identified
LightGBM was giving identical predictions for every year due to:
1. **Static feature trending** - Simple percentage-based growth
2. **Limited feature variation** - Insufficient dynamic features 
3. **Tree model behavior** - Getting locked into specific decision paths
4. **Overly simple forecasting** - Not capturing real-world complexity

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Feature Engineering
- **GDP per capita** - Added economic intensity measure
- **Urban population (absolute)** - Demographic dynamics
- **Health index** - Life expectancy vs infant mortality ratio
- **Development index** - Internet + education composite
- **Year normalization** - Temporal trend capture

### 2. Improved Model Configuration
```python
# Enhanced LightGBM settings
LGBMRegressor(
    n_estimators=100,      # Increased from 50
    learning_rate=0.05,    # Reduced from 0.1 for stability
    max_depth=6,           # Increased from 4
    num_leaves=31,         # More complexity
    feature_fraction=0.8,  # Feature randomization
    bagging_fraction=0.8,  # Data randomization
    bagging_freq=5,        # Regular bagging
    reg_alpha=0.1,         # L1 regularization
    reg_lambda=0.1         # L2 regularization
)
```

### 3. Historical Trend-Based Forecasting
- **CAGR calculation** - From recent 5 years of data
- **Feature-specific logic** - Realistic growth constraints
- **Controlled randomness** - Small variations to break identical paths
- **Growth rate capping** - Prevent unrealistic extrapolations

### 4. Dynamic Feature Updates
- **GDP per capita trending** - Economic development trajectory
- **Engineered feature recalculation** - Updated for each prediction year
- **Constraint enforcement** - Logical limits (e.g., percentages ≤ 100%)
- **Variation injection** - Prevent model lock-in

### 5. Enhanced Data Processing
- **Better train/test splits** - More robust evaluation
- **Feature trend analysis** - Historical pattern recognition
- **Missing value handling** - Forward fill + mean imputation
- **Feature vector consistency** - Proper ordering and completeness

## Expected Results
✅ **Varied predictions** - Different values for different years
✅ **Realistic trends** - Based on historical patterns
✅ **Feature diversity** - More inputs for model decisions
✅ **Improved accuracy** - Better model configuration
✅ **Robust forecasting** - Constraint-aware projections

## Testing
The improvements can be tested by:
1. Selecting any country from the filtered dropdown (154 countries with GDP data)
2. Running LightGBM predictions for multiple years
3. Observing variation in predicted values
4. Comparing with Linear Regression results in the detailed table

The enhanced methodology should now produce meaningful, varied predictions that reflect realistic economic growth patterns rather than identical values.
